## 🧠 How It Works
1. The user selects a **workout mode** (arms, legs, hands, or full body).  
2. The **webcam captures motion** using AI keypoint detection.  
3. The model evaluates movement **accuracy and posture**.  
4. The app generates **real-time feedback** and visual results.  
5. The system logs performance and creates **AI-based reports** for improvement.
